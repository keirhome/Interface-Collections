# Interface Collections Challenge - Assessment

## Before You Start
Please note that assessment is only available to BrightGen employees or by prior 
arrangement with Keir Bowden (aka Bob Buzzard). If you don't satisfy this criteria
your pull request will not be reviewed.

## Setup

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo

Add `keirbowden` as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

Create a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) - name it whatever you like, but note it down!

[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine

On your local machine, switch to your new branch using the command:

`git checkout <branchname>`

## Implementing

Make changes to the artefacts to complete the challenge - make sure that these
changes are reflected in your local filesystem (e.g. use VS Code), as you will 
need to send them back to Github.

Stage your changed files using the command:

`git add <filename>`

and then commit the changes :

`git commit`

and push these to the remote repository

`git push origin <branchname>`

Once you are happy with your solution, [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Then wait!
